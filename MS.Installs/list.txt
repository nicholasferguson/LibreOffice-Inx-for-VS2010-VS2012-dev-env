Please note.  After every install, its best to restart machine
This installation process is here, for a fresh machine.  (new)

One problem with an existing installation is that NET or SDK installed after a Visual Studio...somewhere a config is not properly set.
Did not resolve this issue.

I recommend you download ISO's.  Installation will be much faster.

(1) Install NET Frameworks	ISO name
NET.Framework.450.Full		dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe
NET.Framework.451		NDP451-KB2858728-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe
NET.Framework.452		NDP452-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe

(2) Install Window SDK's

WinSDK.7  ( which iso get useds, depends on CPU type: Intel, AMD..)

WinSDK.8.0			sdksetup.exe

				This will download entire installation to your machine
				Then you install from local HD.
