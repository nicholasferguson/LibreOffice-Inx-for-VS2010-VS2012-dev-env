./autogen.sh   will look for autogen.input

autogen.input are flags used in generating Makefile configure.ac

You can get all of the flags by running

./configure --help > configure.help.log


This is only to be used if you start LibreOffice from scratch

1.	>/opt/lo/bin/make clean
	>./autogen.sh
	>/opt/lo/bin/make


--with-visual-studio=2010  Makefile is 2010 friendly.
--with-package-format=archive     end of make, an archive file is created
				  it is buggy.

--disable-cve-tests		  prevent test during build
				  build will take four hours, anyway.
--with-external-tar=		  Makefile will direct downloaded
